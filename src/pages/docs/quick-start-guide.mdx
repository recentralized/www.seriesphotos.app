Ready to start with Series? Let’s crop and format several photos for social media to learn the basics.

## Watch the Guide

## Read the Guide

Tap the __Add__ button. You’ll see your Recents Photos Album

<DocImage src="quick-start-guide-001-add" />

__Select two photos__ by tapping, then tap the __Add 2__ button

<DocImage src="quick-start-guide-002-add" />

Your content is imported, and Series automatically places each photo centered on a Frame.

## Frame Ratio

The Frame Ratio determines the shape of the layout and the exported images. Creating an Instagram Post? Choose `1:1`, `4:5`, or `5:4`.

## Customize

Try __Contents Fill Cell__ to change how content is cropped. When “off”, content will fit into the layout without cropping. When “on”, content crops to fill the available space.

Try the __Margin slider__. It adjusts how much whitespace is between your photo and the Frame.

While you’re exploring those settings, notice that both Frames are updated. This is batch editing in Series. 


## Preview and Export

Tap the __Share Button__, this brings up the Preview and Export view.

<DocImage src="quick-start-guide-008-preview" />

Tap __Export All__

Series saves an image of each Frame to your Camera Roll, ready to share or upload anywhere.

<DocImage src="quick-start-guide-009-export" />

Tap __Done__ to return to the Layout Editor.
