Series is the best app for formatting photos and videos for Threads. Unlike Instagram, Threads doesn't *require* you to crop most images. But! There's plenty of room for creativity when you want to control how your work is seen.

Note that everything here applies to photos and videos even if we only say photos.


## Single Photos

When posting a single photo, Threads wil display almost any ratio directly in the feed. Share your photo in its natural ratio or use any ratio from Series to combine photos, add a matte, or create layouts.

## Carousels

When you post more than one photo, Threads creates a carousel in the feed. Each photo will display in its natural ratio, up to 3:4 (vertical) or 4:3 (horizontal). If it's taller or wider than that it will be cropped to the center of the image. 

Tapping a photo in the carousel will display it uncropped and full screen.

## Seamless Panoramas

To post a seamless panorama to Threads, do this:

1. Add one photo to Series
2. Tap 'Spread' to split the photo across 2 panels. 
3. Use 'Panels Per Frame' to add more panels to taste
4. Set the Frame Ratio to 9:16 or TH+ [1]
5. Use the 'Margin' tool to remove any border
6. Export!
7. Add the split images (in reverse order) to your post

In the feed, Threads will display the images separately, but when you tap and view full screen you can swipe seamlesssly between them.

[1] You can get an amazing full-screen panorama effect by using the TH+ Frame Ratio, but it might not display perfectly on every device. Threads might change how this works so follow @seriesphotoapp for any updates.


## Other Tricks

Here's some other ideas to get creative control of your Threads posts.

* Use a 1:1, 6:7, 4:5, or 3:4 ratio (or its horizontal counterpart) for carousel posts with Contents Fill Cell to get an even margin around the photo in the feed.
* Use a Margin of 20 or more to inset far enough from the rounded corners added by Threads for a comfortable fit
* Try adding a subtle background color, off-white or off-black to give the photo a consistent matte when anyone views it in either light mode or dark mode.

## Ratios Guide

Here are the best Frame Ratios to use with Threads. Ccarousel posts can use different ratios for each photo.

* 3:4 – The largest horizontal to display uncropped in a carousel
* 4:3 – The largest vertical to display uncropped in a carousel
* 1:1, 4:5, 5:4, 6:7, 7:6 – Other ratios that won't be cropped in a carousel
* 9:16 – Great for non-full-screen Panoramas, or a tall single photo or video.
* TH+ – Full screen panoramas (seamless on almost all devices but not guaranteed). Full screen single images, super-tall single photo or video.
