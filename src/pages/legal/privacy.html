<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective date: February 20, 2019</p>

<p>We at Recentralized know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.  By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</p>

<p>Remember that your use of Recentralized’s Services is at all times subject to the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h2>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile (if applicable), to contact you and allow other users to contact you (if applicable), to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>

<p>As noted in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at legal@recentalized.org.</p>

<h2>Will Recentralized ever change this Privacy Policy?</h2>

<p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.  Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.  If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>

<h2>What information does Recentralized collect?</h2>

<h3>Information You Provide to Us:</h3>

<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and certain third-party account credentials (for example, access tokens for Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other third party sites).  If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, your Content may be stored and accessed via your cloud storage provider, and we may keep a copy of that Content in order to provide the Services to you.  Note that any Content and/or Personal Information stored in any third party account that you access through the Services will not be affected by your use of the Services.  Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>

<p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional or other marketing email offers, or email you about your use of the Services.  Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.  If you do not want to receive marketing or promotional communications from us, please indicate your preference by contacting us at legal@recentalized.org.</p>

<h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>

<p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>

<p>If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Again, this Privacy Policy (and our Cookie Policy) does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.  To learn more about our use of “cookies,” please review our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.  We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>

<h3>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</h3>

<p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</p>

<h2>Will Recentralized sell any of the Personal Information it receives?</h2>

<p>No.  We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, please keep in mind that certain Personal Information may be transferred in connection with business transfers, as described below.</p>

<h2>Will Recentralized share any of the Personal Information it receives?</h2>

<p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section below.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may use third party analytics services, such as Google Firebase, Google Stackdriver, and Google Analytics, to grow our business, improve and develop our Services, monitor and analyze use of our Services, aid our technical administration, increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their requests.  These analytics services may collect and retain some information about you.  Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you use the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information.  We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Information.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.  We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</li>
<li><strong>Our Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we use third party services to help us with marketing emails and survey submissions and responses, and we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.  Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the “Information that’s been de-identified” section below in that regard.</li>
<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.  Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</li>
<li><strong>Protection of Recentralized and Others:</strong> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Recentralized, our employees, our users, or others.</li>
<li><strong>Information that’s been de-identified.</strong> We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners (such as, for example, Google Analytics).  We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.  However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h2>

<p>As further described in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, you may be required to sign up for an account in order to use the Services.  Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>

<p>We seek to protect Personal Information using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Information and applicable processing activity. For example, all Personal Information is transferred via Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology and stored encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.  All Personal Information stored on our Services is hosted on Google Cloud.</p>

<p>While we endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and/or Personal Information we hold in our records, unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

<h2>Where is my Personal Information processed and stored?</h2>

<p>Recentralized is located in the United States, and we will process and store your information, including your Personal Information, on servers in the United States.</p>

<h2>What Personal Information can I access?</h2>

<p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>User profile information, including images and videos you have uploaded to the Recentralized site</li>
</ul>

<p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at legal@recentalized.org</p>

<p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at legal@recentalized.org.</p>

<h2>What choices do I have?</h2>

<p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>

<p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.  When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  You may request deletion of your account and/or Personal Information by using the “Delete Account” feature in your account.  Some information may remain in our records after your request. Any Content and/or Personal Information stored in any third party account that you access through the Services will not be affected by deletion of your account.  We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>

<h2>What if I have questions about this policy?</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to legal@recentalized.org, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
