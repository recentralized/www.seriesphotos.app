Ready to get started with Series? Let’s crop and format several photos for social media to learn the basics.

1. Tap the __Add__ button. You’ll see your Recents Photos Album
2. __Select two photos__ by tapping them
3. Tap the __Add 2__ button

Your content is imported, and Series automatically places each photo centered on a Frame. 

Next, choose a Frame Ratio. The Frame Ratio determines the shape of the layout and the exported images. Creating an Instagram Post? Choose 1:1, 4:5, or 5:4.


## Customize

Try __Contents Fill Cell__ to change how content is cropped. When “off”, content will fit into the layout without cropping. When “on”, content crops to fill the available space.

Try the __Margin slider__. It adjusts how much whitespace is between your photo and the Frame.

While you’re exploring those settings, notice that both Frames are updated. You can change them separately by tapping to select.


## Preview and Export

Tap the __Share icon__, this brings up the Preview and Export view. Swipe to move between Frames to get an Instagram-like preview.

Tap __Export All__. Series saves an image of each Frame to your Camera Roll, ready to share or upload anywhere.


## Great job! 

Tap __Done__ to return to the Layout Editor. 

Tap __Actions__, then __Reset Workspace__ to start fresh. 

That’s it for the Quick Start. Keep exploring to learn more about Series.
