description: Get oriented to the updates.

This guide will help you get oriented to the changes in Series 2.0. There's a lot to explore, but keeping a fast and simple workflow is the goal.


## Video

You can use videos and photos anywhere in the app. Any exported region containing a video will be a video file, otherwise a PNG.


## Import and Export

The __Import__ and __Export__ buttons moved from the bottom of the screen to the top right corner. 


## Reset Workspace

Reset to a fresh layout by tapping __Actions__, then __Reset Workspace__. Choose to Reset Everything, or to remove Content Only, keeping all layout settings.


## Batch Edit

Just like Series 1.0, the default tools modify everything on screen for a uniform look.


## Frames

In Series 1.0, a Frame is a region for export, and the entire layout was spread over a single set of frames.

In Series 2.0, a Frame is a container for layout. And you may have multiple frames with independent layouts. To split content for export, add Panels to a Frame.


## Multiple Frames

With multiple frames—each with its own layout and settings—what used to take several sessions to create is now a single export!

Tap a Frame to select and focus all tools on it. 

Stay oriented with the Panel Header. It shows what’s currently selected and allows navigation to other elements. 


## Layouts

Layouts are more customizable versions of their 1.0 counterparts. 

__Single__ previously known as Border

__Pair__ adds a Sizing tool for Uniform or Relative sized cells

__Spread__ replaces Row, now with Panels tool for controlling how far it spreads

__Row__ replaces Smart Fill, with a Sizing tool for Uniform or Relative sized cells

__Stack__ adds a Sizing tool for Uniform or Relative sized cells

__Grid__ is all new layout with many options


## Fit and Fill

What __Photos Fill Space__ tool is now called __Contents Fill Cell__. 

It works the same; changing whether your content is displayed uncropped, or cropped to fill the available space. There’s more to it, but we’ll cover that later.


## Margin and Edge

The Margin and Edge tools offer more control. Tap the Detail button to adjust each side independently. 


## Background

The Background control opens up plenty of potential. Use color, photo, or video. Save your favorites to reuse across projects. Recent Content lets you quickly apply content already in this layout.


## Templates

Tap the Templates button to find your saved Templates. Create new ones. Tap to apply.


## Preview and Export

This should feel familiar, but tap the Gear icon to explore new Preview and Export options.

Exported images (and videos) are now optimized for Instagram by default (1080 wide).


## Saved Color Settings

In Series 1.0 you could manage your saved colors in Settings. That feature has been removed, but will return with improved tools for managing a library of colors, images, and videos. 


## Frame Ratio Settings

In Series 1.0 you could customize which Frame Ratios were in the Editor. That feature has been removed and all ratios are available in the editor.
